### Reformulated Problem III: Analyzing Predictive Regressions

1. **Understanding the Model:**
   - Analyze the model: $y_t = \beta x_{t-1} + u_t$ and $x_t = \rho x_{t-1} + v_t$, where $u_t$ and $v_t$ are error terms with specified covariance.

2. **Simulation and Analysis:**
   - **Task 1:** Simulate the model using Stambaugh (1999) parameters. For various scenarios, simulate 1000 samples and compute the OLS estimator of $\beta$.
   - **Task 2:** Repeat for two-step and four-step forecasts. Evaluate the OLS slope estimator's standard deviation using naive and Newey-West methods versus the true formula.
   - **Task 3:** Use real-world data from "Irrational Exuberance". Conduct predictive regressions with real prices, guided by Hodrick (1992).

**Guidelines for Answering:**

- **Simulation Setup:** Learn to simulate time series data with the model's parameters.
- **Parameter Variation:** Observe how changes in $\rho$, $\sigma_{uv}$, and sample size affect OLS estimates of $\beta$.
- **Data Analysis:** For real-world data, select variables as suggested, focusing on real prices.
- **Interpretation of Results:** Interpret simulation outcomes and the implications for forecasting.
